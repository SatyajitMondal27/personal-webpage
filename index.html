    <h2>Section 1: About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate student with a strong interest in how people collaborate using technology.
      I am taking this class to better understand communication and coordination software,
      both from a technical and a human-centered perspective. I am especially interested in
      how these tools affect teamwork, productivity, and decision-making in academic and
      professional settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 2: Collaborative Software I Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>WhatsApp</strong> Staying in touch with friends and family through text, voice notes, and group chats.</li>
      <li><strong>Discord:</strong> Communicating while gaming online seeing if friends are playing the same game I am playing.</li>
      <li><strong>Zoom / Google Meet:</strong> Attending online classes, meetings, and group discussions.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Calendar:</strong> Scheduling meetings, setting reminders, and coordinating availability.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Docs:</strong> Collaborative writing, editing documents in real time, and working on shared assignments.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Coordinating software projects, version control, and collaborating on code with others.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Section 3: Helpful Features and Areas for Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      The most helpful features of these tools for me would be real-time collaboration, notifications, 
      and cross-platform . Features like live editing in Google Docs, screen sharing in Zoom, and issue tracking in GitHub make it
      much easier to work together efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, these tools could be improved by improving integration across platforms, 
      and offering better support for accessibility. Sometimes, switching between many different apps can be distracting, 
      and a more unified experience would help streamline collaboration.
